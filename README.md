# Weather-Forecast-using-Python
I have used "requests" module in my source code.
In this weather forecasting project we can forecast the weather for 3 days with the help of "wttr".
You can run the "mowa.py", enter city name as input and get the weather forecast for 3 days using python in different IDE's.
As I have used Visual Studio Code as python IDE, version is Python3.10.
I have also uploaded Sample output screenshot of the code.
